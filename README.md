# Student Performance Project

This project analyzes student performance based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file named 'stud.csv'.

To begin with, the project imports necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.graph_objects. 

### Aim of the Project:

The overarching goal of the Student Performance Project is to conduct a thorough analysis of factors influencing students' academic performance. This study delves into the intricate relationships between student achievement and various socio-demographic variables, including gender, race/ethnicity, parental education levels, lunch type, and completion of test preparation courses.

Furthermore, the project endeavors to employ advanced machine learning models to predict student math score based on the other features. 

### Challenges and Solutions:

##### 1. Categorical Variable Handling:

- **Challenge:** Efficiently handling categorical variables (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, parental education) during preprocessing.

- **Solution:** Utilize encoding techniques like one hot encoder and explore advanced methods (e.g., target encoding). Regularly assess encoding choices' impact on model performance.

##### 2. Overfitting and Model Generalization:

- **Challenge:** Addressing overfitting concerns to ensure models generalize well to new data.

- **Solution:** Implement K-fold cross-validation, L1 and L2 regularization methods during model training, providing a robust evaluation metric. 

## Project Overview:

###  Data Import and Exploration:

1. Utilize the pandas library to import the 'stud.csv' dataset and convert it to a dataframe.
2. Conduct a meticulous exploration of the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents.
3. Scrutinize the data for potential missing or inconsistent values, ensuring data integrity.

###  Descriptive Analysis:

1. Employ descriptive statistics to succinctly summarize key characteristics inherent in the dataset.
2. Generate visually compelling distributions to showcase the spread of scores in math, reading, and writing tests.
3. Investigate and visualize relationships between different factors (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) and student performance, providing a holistic view.

###  Machine Learning Models:

1. Initiate the preprocessing phase, encompassing the handling of categorical variables and the scaling of numerical features.
2. Execute a strategic split of the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate robust model evaluation.
3. Implement  machine learning models to predict math score based on other features.
4. Rigorously evaluate model performance using r2 score and others metrics, ensuring a robust assessment of predictive capabilities.



##  Libraries Used:

1. NumPy: Facilitating numerical operations.
2. Pandas: Driving efficient data manipulation and analysis.
3. Seaborn and Matplotlib: Crafting visually compelling data visualizations.
4. Plotly: Enabling interactive and dynamic visualizations.
5. Scikit-learn: Harnessing a rich suite of machine learning algorithms for model development and evaluation.

By seamlessly integrating exploratory data analysis, advanced machine learning methodologies, and insightful feature interpretation, this project aspires to furnish a comprehensive comprehension of student performance dynamics, paving the way for informed interventions and predictive modeling advancements in the educational landscape.

##  Overall insights:

In the analysis, it was observed that students who received a standard lunch performed better compared to those with a free/reduced lunch. Additionally, students belonging to group E generally performed well in all aspects compared to students from other race/ethnicity groups.

In short, this project is designed to provide a clear understanding of student performance based on various factors.
